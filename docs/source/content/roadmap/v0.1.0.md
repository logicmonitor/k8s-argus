This release focuses on the automated management of the following:

-   **Device Tree**
-   **Devices**
-   **Device Properties**

## Device Tree Management
In this release, Argus will have an opinionated way of representing a cluster in the LogicMonitor Device Tree.
It will first create a top level device group with the name of your cluster as specified in the arguments to the chart.
Under this top level device group, four additional device groups will be created for each supported resource type:

-   **Nodes:** The nodes that the cluster is comprised of.
-   **Pods:** Pods running in the cluster.
-   **Services:** Services running in the cluster.

For namespaced resources (Pods, Services), a device group will be created for each namespace and placed inside the respective resource device group.
For clusters that use an external etcd cluster, an **Etcd** device group will be created in the cluster's root device group.

## Device Management
To keep up with the everchanging topology of a Kubernetes cluster, Argus subscribes to the Kubernetes API event stream for each resource type mentioned in [Device Tree Management](#device-tree-management). Upon receiving an event, Argus decides on how to represent the event in LogicMonitor.


## Device Property Management
Argus will map Kubernetes metadata to device properties.
