Argus is a tool that helps users of [LogicMonitor](https://www.logicmonitor.com)
 keep up with the highly dynamic nature of a Kubernetes cluster. Argus runs as a
 Pod in your cluster, and uses LogicMonitor's API to add Nodes, Pods, and
 Services into monitoring. Once in monitoring, data collection starts
 automatically. Data is collected for Nodes, Pods, Containers, and Services via
 the Kubernetes API. Additionally, you can leverage LogicMonitor DataSources to
 monitor your applications running within the cluster.
